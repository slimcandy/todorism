# [Evency](http://todorism.netlify.app)

Evency is a web project that helps hiking teams create and manage shared todo lists for organizing their trips. With Evency, teams can easily keep track of expenses, necessary items, and more, without the hassle of manually tracking everything on paper or in a Google Sheet.

## Problem Solved

Evency was created to solve the common problem of difficulty in keeping shared todo lists organized, especially for hiking teams. Using Google Sheets or Trello can be time-consuming and cumbersome, and may not offer all the features that hiking teams need to effectively manage their trips.
